Hi everyone, i just wanted to allow you to have some fun with my ulimateBravery app.

To install this, you just have to download the files and to place them in a folder.
Then you open the HTML file and here we go, you have your random build. To have an another one,
you can refresh the page.


It is pretty simple to use, you just have to open/refresh the html page to generate a new build.

All of these are generated:
- A champion
- The spells
- Boots
- 5 final items

To see the name of the items, you just have to hover the images and the name will appear.

Some legends are missing, i will continue to register them lately.
